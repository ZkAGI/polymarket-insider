COMPLETED: SETUP-001 - Initialize Git repository
- Created comprehensive .gitignore for Node.js/TypeScript project
- Includes: node_modules, dist, .next, .env*, coverage, IDE files, OS files, logs, TypeScript build info, Prisma DB files
- Created initial commit with all foundational files
- Verified: .git folder exists and properly configured

COMPLETED: SETUP-002 - Initialize package.json
- Created package.json with project metadata (name, version, description)
- Added scripts: dev, build, start, test, test:watch, lint, lint:fix, format, format:check, typecheck
- Set up for Next.js + Vitest + ESLint + Prettier
- Created .nvmrc to lock Node version to 20.17.0
- Verified: npm install runs with 0 vulnerabilities

COMPLETED: SETUP-003 - Configure TypeScript
- Installed typescript and @types/node as dev dependencies
- Created tsconfig.json with strict mode and additional strict checks
- Configured path aliases: @/*, @/api/*, @/components/*, @/lib/*, @/utils/*
- Set outDir to ./dist, moduleResolution to "bundler"
- Added extra strict options: noUncheckedIndexedAccess, noImplicitReturns, noUnusedLocals, noUnusedParameters
- Created src/index.ts as test file
- Verified: tsc --noEmit passes with no errors

COMPLETED: SETUP-004 - Configure ESLint and Prettier
- Installed eslint, prettier, typescript-eslint, and related plugins
- Created eslint.config.mjs (flat config for ESLint 9.x)
- Created .prettierrc with formatting preferences (semi, double quotes, 100 print width)
- Created .prettierignore to exclude node_modules, dist, etc.
- Updated lint scripts in package.json for ESLint 9.x compatibility
- Verified: npm run lint passes with no errors
- Verified: npm run format works correctly

NOTES:
- Project uses Node.js v20.17.0 (run `nvm use` to switch)
- ESLint 9.x uses flat config (eslint.config.mjs) instead of .eslintrc.js
- Next up: SETUP-005 (Set up project directory structure)
