- Set outDir to ./dist, moduleResolution to "bundler"
- Added extra strict options: noUncheckedIndexedAccess, noImplicitReturns, noUnusedLocals, noUnusedParameters
- Created src/index.ts as test file
- Verified: tsc --noEmit passes with no errors

COMPLETED: SETUP-004 - Configure ESLint and Prettier
- Installed eslint, prettier, typescript-eslint, and related plugins
- Created eslint.config.mjs (flat config for ESLint 9.x)
- Created .prettierrc with formatting preferences (semi, double quotes, 100 print width)
- Created .prettierignore to exclude node_modules, dist, etc.
- Updated lint scripts in package.json for ESLint 9.x compatibility
- Verified: npm run lint passes with no errors
- Verified: npm run format works correctly

COMPLETED: SETUP-005 - Set up project directory structure
- Created src/ with subdirectories: api, detection, ui, notifications, ai, utils
- Created tests/ with matching structure (api, detection, ui, notifications, ai, utils)
- Created config/ for configuration files
- Added .gitkeep files to ensure empty directories are tracked
- Verified: All directories exist with correct structure

COMPLETED: SETUP-006 - Configure environment variables
- Installed dotenv package
- Created .env.example with all required variables (DATABASE_URL, API URLs, notification settings, whale thresholds)
- Created config/env.ts with typed environment access and validation
- Includes helper functions: getEnvVar, getEnvVarOptional, getEnvVarAsNumber, getEnvVarAsBoolean
- .env already in .gitignore from SETUP-001
- Verified: typecheck passes on config/env.ts
- Verified: .env.example can be copied to .env successfully

COMPLETED: SETUP-007 - Set up testing framework
- Installed vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 as dev dependencies
- Created vitest.config.ts with:
  - Node environment, globals enabled
  - Test file patterns: tests/**/*.test.ts, tests/**/*.spec.ts
  - Coverage with v8 provider
  - Path aliases matching tsconfig.json
- Created tests/index.test.ts with 7 sample tests
- Verified: npm test runs successfully with all 7 tests passing

COMPLETED: SETUP-008 - Set up database with Prisma
- Installed prisma (dev) and @prisma/client
- Created prisma/schema.prisma with PostgreSQL provider
- Initial schema includes models:
  - Market: Polymarket market data (id, slug, question, category, volume, etc.)
  - Outcome: Market outcomes with probabilities
  - Wallet: Tracked wallet addresses (whale/insider flags)
  - Trade: Individual trades with USD values
  - PriceHistory: Price data for charting
  - Alert: Notification alerts
- DATABASE_URL already configured in .env from SETUP-006
- Verified: npx prisma validate passes

NOTES:
- Project uses Node.js v20.17.0 (run `nvm use` to switch)
- ESLint 9.x uses flat config (eslint.config.mjs) instead of .eslintrc.js
- Run `npm test` for single run, `npm run test:watch` for watch mode
- Run `npx prisma db push` to sync schema with database
- Next up: SETUP-009 (Set up Next.js frontend)
